Clavicom is a music composition program for the Amstrad CPC computer
that I wrote as my ‘A’-level computer science project. It’s written in
BCPL. I think there was a C version, written in HiSoft C, first of all,
and then this was a rewrite for the ‘A’-level. Anyway, I spent a lot of
time entering music, and refining the program to do things like repeats,
tempo changes, and so on, in order to get the music sounding good. I got
a very good mark for this project. Most other people did theirs in BBC
BASIC, and I think it was unusual to used a compiled language.
